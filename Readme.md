# Phishing Detection Using NLP Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a phishing detection system utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to identify potentially malicious content within emails and messages, providing an additional layer of security for users.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy)
- Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest)
- Hyperopt (hyperparameter optimization)
- Mlflow (for model and artifacts version control)

## Dataset

The model was trained on a diverse dataset comprising of both phishing and legitimate messages. The dataset was carefully curated to ensure a representative sample.

## Key Steps

### Data Import

### Distribution Visualization

### Word Cloud

### Baseline Model

    - Text Preprocessing 
    - Baseline Model Training 

### Optimized Model

    - Creating and setting up a MLFlow experiment
    - Creating Text Preprocessing Pipeline
    - Hyper-parameter ptimization with hyperopt
    - Registering best model
    - Getting Prediction from best model

## Results

The best model achieved an accuracy of about 98\% on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying phishing attempts.
